### Biochemistry
- [Biochemistry Lab Manual](https://open.oregonstate.education/chembiolab)
  - Proteins play vital roles in most biological processes; these roles include acting as catalysts for physiological reactions, as regulators for those reactions, or as structural framework around which these processes can occur. Proteins’ complex organization of diverse functionality in 3D space leads to an astonishing range of function for living organisms. Understanding this intimate relationship between structure and function is the backbone of understanding the natural world and is the key to controlling it.

### Epidemiology
- [Foundations of Epidemiology](https://open.oregonstate.education/epidemiology)
  - Foundations of Epidemiology is an open access, introductory epidemiology text intended for students and practitioners in public or allied health fields. It covers epidemiologic thinking, causality, incidence and prevalence, public health surveillance, epidemiologic study designs and why we care about which one is used, measures of association, random error and bias, confounding and effect modification, and screening.
  - Concepts are illustrated with numerous examples drawn from contemporary and historical public health issues.

### Animal and Plant Sciences
#### Animal Nutrition
- [A Guide to the Principles of Animal Nutrition](https://open.oregonstate.education/animalnutrition)

#### Marine Law
- [Marine Law and Policy for Scientists and Managers](https://open.oregonstate.education/mlpsm)

#### Entomology - Study of Insects
- [Entomology 311 Lab Manual](https://open.oregonstate.education/entomology-lab-manual)
  - Labs in this book supplement the information gained in lecture, as well as providing some perspective and experience with hands-on applications of ideas in pest management. The labs are presented in week-by-week order, so the pre-labs and reading for week 1 are labeled “Pre-Lab 1” and “Week 1 Reading”.

#### Ecosystems
- [Rangeland Ecosystems of the Western US](https://open.oregonstate.education/rangelandecosystems)
  - Rangeland Ecosystems of the Western US conveys fundamentals of autecology and synecology and general information about the primary ecosystems covered. Its structure will provide a framework that can be applied to understand and analyze any arid shrubland, desert, or woodland savanna
- [Wildlife Habitat Management](https://open.oregonstate.education/wildlifehabitat)

#### Climate Science
- [Introduction to Climate Science](https://open.oregonstate.education/climatechange)
  - This book describes how Earth's climate is changing, how it has been changing in the recent geological past and how it may change in the future. It covers the physical sciences that build the foundations of our current understanding of global climate change such as radiation, Earth's energy balance, the greenhouse effect and the carbon cycle. Both natural and human causes for climate change are discussed. Impacts of climate change on natural and human systems are summarized. Ethical and economical aspects of human-caused climate change and solutions are presented.

#### Plants
- [History and Science of Cultivated Plants](https://open.oregonstate.education/cultivatedplants)
  - History and Science of Cultivated Plants narrates how humans transitioned from foragers to farmers and have arrived at present-day industrial agriculture-based civilization. It entails myths, historical accounts, and scientific concepts to describe how human efforts have shaped and produced easier to grow, larger, tastier, and more nutritious fruits, vegetables, and grains from wild plants. Using examples of various economically and socially important crops central to human civilization, the book describes the origin of crop plants, the evolution of agricultural practices, fundamental concepts of natural selection vs. domestication, experimental and methodical plant breeding, and plant biotechnology
